
Note: All the programs have been written in Java

Program 1:

The function - public static double calculate(double a, double b, String operation)
takes 3 arguments i.e 2 operands of the type double and 1 operator of the type String

Switch block is used to solve this problem. 

An exception is generated when the operand is invalid.

Program 2:

If the input is a negative number, we print a warning message onto the console.

for(int i=1;i<=2*x-1;i+=2) - We are going to print all the odd numbers between 1 and 2*x-1

Program 3:

Program 3 is nothing but a slight modification of program 2.

if(x%2==0) { x=x-1;}
The only change between program 2 and 3 is that in program 3, we decrement x by 1 if x is an even number.


Program 4:

We iterate over each of the input elements for all the numbers 1,2,..,9

We store the count of the number of elements that are disible by a particular number 1,2,...,9 
and add [key, value]= [each number from 1,...,9 , count of number of elements divisible by key]
in the HashMap.
